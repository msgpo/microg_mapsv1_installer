## microG 
This is a Magisk module that installs [microg/android_frameworks_mapsv1](https://github.com/microg/android_frameworks_mapsv1).

## Why you may want to install it
Version 1 of the Google Maps Android API as been officially [deprecated as of December 3rd, 2012](https://commonsware.com/blog/2012/12/17/maps-v1-keys-going-going.html). That means you should not install this unless you know why you need it. Maybe you have some antiquated app you want to revive, but I am not sure if Google still supports it at all.
I created this module just so I could install a current app (ObsMapp) for which the developer has forgotten to remove the old dependency.
